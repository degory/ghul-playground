// Opening and saving a program as a file on the reader's own machine.

// Two mechanisms, because only some browsers have the good one. The File
// System Access API opens a file and writes back to that same file, which is
// what "save" has to mean; Firefox and Safari have neither half of it, so
// there opening is an <input type="file"> and saving is a download, which can
// only ever be "save a copy". The menu says which of the two it is doing
// rather than offering a Save that quietly means something else.
//
// This is not where the editor's contents are kept safe. The buffer is written
// to local storage on every edit and restored on load, so closing the tab
// without saving loses nothing; a file is for taking the program somewhere
// else.

// Whether this browser can write back to a file it opened. Both halves are
// checked: a browser with only the picker would offer a Save that cannot save.

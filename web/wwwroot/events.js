// Counting what a reader does, for the pages that do any counting at all.
//
// One event is one path, because the counter has no properties: everything an
// event says has to be in its path, and the first segment is the family the
// report groups on. Paths stay low-cardinality on purpose - a family and a
// small closed set of outcomes - and nothing a reader typed, no source text and
// no message from the compiler ever reaches one.
//
// Counting is never allowed to matter. Every call is safe when the counter is
// absent, when the reader has opted out, when storage throws, and when it is
// called before count.js has loaded.

// The counter is loaded with `async`, so the first events of a page load land
// before it exists. They wait here rather than going uncounted, which is what
// the run-on-arrival event needed when it was the only one.

// for a counter that will discard it.
